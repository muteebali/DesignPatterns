## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to the **ultimate C# / .NET repository of all 23 Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns**!  

This repo is perfect for:

- **Learning & Practicing** design patterns.  
- **Improving code quality** with reusable, maintainable solutions.  
- **Interview prep** for software engineering roles.  
- **Real-world application** in professional projects.  

All patterns are implemented with **clean, modular C# code** and explained using **practical examples** and **real-life analogies**.

## 📚 Covered Patterns

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** – Ensure a class has only one instance.  
- **Factory Method** – Create objects without specifying the exact class.  
- **Abstract Factory** – Families of related objects.  
- **Builder** – Step-by-step object creation.  
- **Prototype** – Clone existing objects.

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** – Convert interface to expected type.  
- **Bridge** – Decouple abstraction from implementation.  
- **Composite** – Tree structure of objects.  
- **Decorator** – Add responsibilities dynamically.  
- **Facade** – Simplify complex systems.  
- **Flyweight** – Optimize memory via sharing.  
- **Proxy** – Control access to an object.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility** – Pass requests along a chain.  
- **Command** – Encapsulate requests as objects.  
- **Interpreter** – Evaluate custom languages.  
- **Iterator** – Sequential access to collections.  
- **Mediator** – Object communication through mediator.  
- **Memento** – Capture & restore state.  
- **Observer** – Notify objects on state change.  
- **State** – Change behavior when state changes.  
- **Strategy** – Interchangeable algorithms.  
- **Template Method** – Skeleton algorithm, customizable steps.  
- **Visitor** – Operate on object structures without changing them.
